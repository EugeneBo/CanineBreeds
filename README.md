# CanineBreeds
A small application that uses the JSON API provided by https://dog.ceo/.  
It loads a list of dog breeds from the server and after selecting the breed,  
loads and displays all available photos of the selected breed of dogs.  

The application will be improved as I study new technologies and libraries.
